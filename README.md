Tic Tac Toe Game


![Test Passed](https://github.com/daviddangtim/TicTacToeGame/assets/132671801/5dd35c2d-562e-4884-8417-a241cd5ce85a)

Plan Tests: First, we outlined the game's behavior by defining various test cases. These tests were like a "wish list" for how the game should work.

Initial Failing Tests: When we ran the tests, they naturally failed because we hadn't written any game code yet. This was an important step to validate that the tests were effective.

Start with Basic Code: We began by writing the most basic code necessary to make the failing tests pass. This included creating the game board and some initial methods.

Test and Adjust: We repeatedly tested the code and made adjustments to meet the test criteria. The goal was to ensure that the game could be played, moves could be made, and wins/draws could be detected.

Refactor and Extend: After passing the tests, we cleaned up and improved the code. Additional tests were added to cover different game scenarios. This cycle of testing, adjusting, and extending the code continued.

Completion and Validation: The development process was considered finished when all tests passed, and the game worked as intended. This approach ensured that the code was reliable and met the game's requirements.
